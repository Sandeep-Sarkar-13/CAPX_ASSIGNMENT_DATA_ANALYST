This growth took the company from a market cap near $1 trillion to a market cap of about $1.2 trillion, good for a $200 billion surge, possibly the largest in history. 

Meta also announced a $50 billion stock buyback and a new shareholder dividend.

stocks,stock market,Pelosi rejects stock-trading ban for members of Congress: 'We are free market economy. They should be able to participate in that',"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday rejected the idea of banning members of Congress and their spouses from holding and trading individual stocks while in office.

""This is a free market, and people — we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that,"" Pelosi said when asked by Insider at her weekly press conference.

Insider also asked Pelosi about ""Conflicted Congress,"" a 5-month-long investigation by Insider that found 49 members of Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers have violated the STOCK Act, a law to prevent Insider trading.

The Speaker said she had not yet seen the project, but said that it's important that members are complying with the law.

""If people aren't reporting, they should be,"" she said.

Pelosi's position puts her at odds with the likes of progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom have called for banning members of congress from trading stocks while in office.

""It is absolutely ludicrous that members of Congress can hold and trade individual stock while in office,"" Ocasio-Cortez recently wrote on Twitter. ""The access and influence we have should be exercised for the public interest, not our profit. It shouldn't be legal for us to trade individual stock with the info we have.""

And on Tuesday, Sen. Warren told Insider that she had seen Insider's investigation, calling out the ""brazenness"" of members and staffers trading stocks even while having access to privileged knowledge.

""We need both tougher laws and enforcement of those laws,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told Insider. ""The American people should never have to guess whether or not an elected official is advancing an issue or voting on a bill based on what's good for the country or what's good for their own personal financial interests."" 

Asked about progressives' position on the issue, a spokesman for Pelosi signaled that the speaker prefers a transparency-focused approach to insider trading.

""The STOCK Act exists to shine a bright light on trades by members of Congress,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill. ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant.""

""The speaker does not own any stocks,"" he continued. ""As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked 'SP' for spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.""

Pelosi's husband, investor Paul Pelosi, frequently trades significant numbers of stocks. With her husband's assets considered, Pelosi ranks among the wealthiest members of Congress, according to an Insider analysis.

Insider has identified numerous examples of federal lawmakers trading stocks in industries they oversee as part of their congressional committee assignments, including within the defense, healthcare, and energy industries.

stocks,investment,"Charlie Munger, investing genius and Warren Buffett’s right-hand man, dies at age 99","Billionaire Charlie Munger, the investing sage who made a fortune even before he became Warren Buffett’s right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, has died at age 99.  
  
Munger died Tuesday, according to a press release from Berkshire Hathaway.  
  
In addition to being Berkshire vice chairman, Munger was a real estate attorney, chairman and publisher of the Daily Journal Corp., a member of the Costco board, a philanthropist and an architect.  
  
In early 2023, his fortune was estimated at $2.3 billion — a jaw-dropping amount for many people but vastly smaller than Buffett’s unfathomable fortune, which is estimated at more than $100 billion.  
  
During Berkshire’s 2021 annual shareholder meeting, the then-97-year-old Munger apparently inadvertently revealed a well-guarded secret: that Vice Chairman Greg Abel “will keep the culture” after the Buffett era.  
  
Munger, who wore thick glasses, had lost his left eye after complications from cataract surgery in 1980.  
  
Munger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from 1984 to 2011, when Buffett’s Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena, California-based insurance and investment company it did not own.  
  
Buffett credited Munger with broadening his investment strategy from favoring troubled companies at low prices in hopes of getting a profit to focusing on higher-quality but underpriced companies.  
  
An early example of the shift was illustrated in 1972 by Munger’s ability to persuade Buffett to sign off on Berkshire’s purchase of See’s Candies for $25 million even though the California candy maker had annual pretax earnings of only about $4 million. It has since produced more than $2 billion in sales for Berkshire.  
  
“He weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,” Buffett told CNBC in May 2016.  
  
Or as Munger put it at the 1998 Berkshire shareholder meeting: “It’s not that much fun to buy a business where you really hope this sucker liquidates before it goes broke.”  
  
Munger was often the straight man to Buffett’s jovial commentaries. “I have nothing to add,” he would say after one of Buffett’s loquacious responses to questions at Berkshire annual meetings in Omaha, Nebraska. But like his friend and colleague, Munger was a font of wisdom in investing, and in life. And like one of his heroes, Benjamin Franklin, Munger’s insight didn’t lack humor.  
  
“I have a friend who says the first rule of fishing is to fish where the fish are. The second rule of fishing is to never forget the first rule. We’ve gotten good at fishing where the fish are,” the then-93-year-old Munger told the thousands of people at Berkshire’s 2017 meeting.  
  
He believed in what he called the “lollapalooza effect,” in which a confluence of factors merged to drive investment psychology.

stocks,investment,"Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors","https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

""We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,"" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. ""Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.""

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

""Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,"" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. ""Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.""

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

""These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,"" Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

""Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,"" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. ""To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.""

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

stocks,investment,Investing in Costco today is actually betting against it,"Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. 

Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. 

But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:

1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter

2) Stock split = $$$  

3) My local Costco has long lines 

Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. 

A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. 

And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. 

- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) 

- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco

- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend 

- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect 

- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals

- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not 

- eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships",891,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fpzm9a/investing_in_costco_today_is_actually_betting/

I mean with inflation, divisiveness, covid, labor shortages, supply chains, China, Russia, war etc....

I really feel like we are in for some real pain in the coming years, especially in the market.

I used to think ""Oh it'll all turn around in a year or so and we'll be off to new highs"", but I'm feeling like more and more we're just going to be in the same churning market for at very least through 2024.

I just don't see anything in the macro getting better for at very least a couple more years and maybe even 5.

I think the Ukraine thing is just gonna get worse and worse and theres no way the market will go higher with that situation.

Then there's China ....

In my 46 years I must say that from late 2019 till now the world has been a real ""shipshow""!

So does anyone see a new bull any time soon or am I right in thinking maybe 2024 at earliest?

I hate to admit it, and I'm no expert by any means, but I could see us between 2500 and 4200 for 5 more years ....

Please tell me I'm wrong ....",1185,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xtppnc/i_have_a_fear_that_we_wont_have_a_bull_market_for/
stocks,bull market,Bull market or bull trap?,"Did the recession just end or is it just beginning? Is inflation preparing to come down or is it just momentarily slowing down? Was Jpows sentiment as bullish as the market represented? Reddit, Twitter and most main stream investors seem to be pretty bullish but this sentiment seems to be pretty new. Curious what you guys think. I’m personally leaning bearish because I think the market is pricing in rate cuts and a dovish landing which I just don’t see as being realistic.

stocks,bull market,I haven’t seen so many bullish indicators in past 9 years of investing my money. We in the mid of the secular bull market,"It’s very interesting reading over this and other subs with influx of new people wasting their time and energy on trying to explain daily move without looking at the big picture , the biggest difference you will spot between people with and without experience is that after you been investing for a while you stop carrying what is happening and why day to day or even month to month  , you just accept randomness of market with millions buyers and sellers who all have their own goals and plans and insensitive doing their thing and sometimes they buy more and sometimes they sell more, life goes on.

So , let’s look at the big picture to understand why we going to have a crazy bull run that’s been happening since 2013 ( some argue 2020 was reset , but imo it was event driven violent pullback and rally back with same intensity , I would argue until we go down -20% and stay there for couple month bull market is not dead )

1.

XLF , financial ETF, you know, boomer shit like banks etc no sexy SQ or PayPal fin tech,  we broke off 2007 top we had pre 2008 explosion when ETF still had BS and Lehman , spreads benefits banks and good for profits and if the banks are making money it’s good for market , I don’t think we ever had a serious market issues if banking sector doing good 

2. Euro 600

STOXX 600, dead money for 20 years and we finally past 2000 peak , could be false breakout but we shall see, euro full of boomer shit like banks and old economy companies , I am not super bullish on them but why not own them at cheaper valuation then USA ,half the people who jerk off to Warren B would love to try to dumpster dive  and pick nuggets or just buy who basket 

3. Japan and emerging markets 

Both outperformed sp500 in 2020. Japan , out of all indexes , hard to be bear when even that part of world working 

4.  QQQ

“ Rising rates are bad for tech “ bullshit , sure some idiotic things will be killed , sorry if you decided to go all in on car company valued at 1 mil per car sold ever , it’s probably overpriced but we don’t care, find support group where you tell each other in circles how it’s tech/energy/ self-driving company , for other people exhibit A:

Last rate hike cycle and rates going up, fall 2015 to fall 2018, rates were up 40% on relative basis , QQQ was up 90%+, so tech will be fine but some priced to perfection and overhyped stocks will be killed, oh well , they all did insane 2020, don’t feel bad for them 

5.  Absolutely insane amount of Fiscal support for masses
In 2008 we saved banks and let everyone get killed, in 2020 we send people UBI checks , didn’t let them get for closed on, expanded unemployment benefits and gave tax breaks for people with kids, it could never be more different then last recession and it’s hard to be a bear when Americans have the highest savings rate in the history of this country ever with trillions of $$$ of liquidity flying around the world looking what assets to get into 



In the early days of the Twentieth Century, when J.P. Morgan ruled Wall Street, a visitor came to the City. He was a long-time friend of Morgan, a commodity trader from Chicago. He was what might be called a “perma bear” following the Panic of 1907. No matter how high or low the stock market went, his outlook was pessimistic. Another crash, panic and depression were just around the corner.
This was his first visit to the world’s greatest city. He arrived at 23 Wall Street, and was ushered into J.P.’s spacious office overlooking the Exchange on one side and George Washington’s statue on the other.
They immediately began talking about the markets, Morgan being bullish as ever, and his commodity friend being as bearish as ever. “J.P.,” he said, “the news overseas doesn’t look too good.”
“A buying opportunity!” responded Morgan.
After an hour of friendly disputing about the markets, Morgan invited his guest to join him for lunch. They walked outside and started moving up toward Broadway. As they did so, his friend couldn’t help but admire the skyscrapers that dotted the Manhattan horizon. Morgan gave him a tour of the giant buildings, pointing out the Singer Building, the Woolworth Building across from City Hall, the famous three-sided Flatiron Building, and the recently completed Met Life Tower, rising 50 stories high, the tallest skyscraper in the world at the time.
His friend was duly impressed,. He said he had never seen anything like it, not even in Chicago.
Finally, J.P. Morgan stopped his friend and said, “Funny thing about these skyscrapers – not a single one was built by a bear!”

stocks,bull market,WSJ - S&P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,"U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&P 500’s longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run. 

The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.

Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market’s advance Thursday. 

That helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.

Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.

So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead. 

“A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. 

Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.

Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.

GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman. 

U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.

Global stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%. The Stoxx Europe 600 finished about flat.

stocks,bear market,Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

stocks,bear market,Conditions Are Ripe for a Deep Bear Market,"The risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don’t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence

https://www.wsj.com/articles/conditions-are-ripe-for-a-deep-bear-market-11653166864?mod=hp_trending_now_article_pos1

With the S&P 500 briefly on Friday down 20% from its January peak, it is very tempting to start trying to call the end of the selloff. The problem is that only one of the conditions for a rally is in place, that everyone’s scared. That worked beautifully for timing the start of the 2020 rebound, but this time around may not be enough.

The other requirements are that investors start to see a way through the challenges, and that policy makers start to help. Without those, the risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don’t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence.

This time central bankers are scared not by falling markets or the economic outlook, but by ***inflation.*** Sure, if something major breaks in the financial system, they will refocus on finance, and a recession may prompt them to rethink rate rises. But for now, ***inflation means that falling stock prices are seen merely as a side effect of tighter monetary policy, not a reason to invoke the “Fed put” and rescue investors.***

There is nothing magical about a fall of 20%, the usual definition of a bear market. But it does crop up a lot: In the past 40 years, the S&P 500 has bottomed out with a 20%-or-so peak-to-trough decline four times, in 1990, 1998, 2011 and 2018. Another four times it had far bigger losses, as true panic took hold.

***The common factor in the 20% drops was the Federal Reserve. Each time, the market bottomed out when the central bank eased monetary policy, with the stock market’s fall perhaps helping push the Fed to take the threats more seriously then it otherwise might.***

My concern is that this time could be more like 1973-1974. Just as then, the primary concern of the country is inflation, thanks to a war-related oil-price shock. Just as then, the inflationary shock took hold when the Fed had rates far too low given the scale of political stimulus for the economy. Just as then, favored stocks—the Nifty Fifty, now the FANGS and associated acronyms—had soared in prior years.

Most important, in 1974 ***the Fed kept raising rates even as a recession took hold because it was running to catch up with inflation. The result was a horrible bear market interspersed with soul-destroying temporary rallies, two of 10%, two of 8% and two of 7%, each snuffed out. It took 20 months before the low was reached—not coincidentally, when the Fed finally began to get serious about cutting rates.***

---

To be clear, this article is not predicting a bear market, just saying that conditions are almost optimal for one to occur.  The market can of course stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent if you bet against it.  Regardless, ***Don't Fight the Fed***.",1535,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v0uo7g/conditions_are_ripe_for_a_deep_bear_market/

“During the Financial Crisis, the market head-faked investors with three minor rallies from fall '07 through summer '08 — of 8%, 12%, and then 7%, respectively — suckering in new longs near the 2007 record highs.

And then markets really started messing with investors.

Declines of 45% and 51% from record highs were met with rallies of 18% and 24% in the fall of 2008, moves that came several months before the market's ultimate bottom in March 2009.

Suddenly, headlines were reading: ""Stock market 20% off the lows,"" enticing traumatized investors to possibly pull the trigger on what remained of their cash position — only to see new lows in the coming weeks and months.

During the dot-com bubble burst, it took nearly three years for the bear market to finally shake out bagholders from the first tech mania.

The S&P 500 dropped 49% from record highs before hitting its ultimate bottom in late 2002. Over the course of 2001 and 2002, the S&P 500 saw no fewer than four rallies of 19% or more.

stocks,bear market,WSJ - S&P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,"U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&P 500’s longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run. 

The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.

Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market’s advance Thursday. 

That helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.

Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.

So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead. 

“A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. 

Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.

Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.

GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman. 

U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.

Global stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%. The Stoxx Europe 600 finished about flat.

stocks,Tesla,Tesla shares close down 12% after earnings miss for biggest slump since 2020 ,"Tesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue.

The stock closed down 12% on Wednesday at $215.99. It’s now down 13% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over that stretch.

Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7% from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion.

The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition, especially in China.

Tesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far, but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk’s incendiary and political commentary.

Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents, according to LSEG. And Tesla’s adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. It’s the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage.

Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story, including when the company will introduce a new mass-market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new “affordable” car in the first half of next year.

Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber-style ride-hailing service, with the cars driving autonomously.

When asked when he expects the first robotaxi ride, Musk said, “I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”

Musk has a history of promising things on a particular timeline and not delivering. On Tuesday, he pushed back the date of the company’s robotaxi event to October, after previously saying it would take place in August.

“This is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle,” Musk said, adding that Tesla is “going to show up a couple of other things.” He didn’t provide details.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",1702,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/
stocks,Tesla,Tesla asks shareholders to approve CEO Musk's 2018 pay voided by judge,"April 17 (Reuters) - Electric automaker Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab on Wednesday asked shareholders to ratify billionaire Elon Musk's compensation that was set in 2018 under the CEO pay package, just months after a Delaware judge rejected it.
The judge had tossed out Musk's record-breaking $56 billion pay in January, calling the compensation granted by the board ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders.
Tesla also urged its investors to approve moving the company's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in a regulatory filing.

Shares of the world's most valuable automaker were up 1% before the bell.

stocks,Tesla,Musk lays off Tesla senior executives,"Elon Musk has dismissed two Tesla senior executives and plans to lay off hundreds more employees, frustrated by falling sales and the pace of job cuts so far, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing the CEO’s email to senior managers.

Rebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker’s Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of the new vehicles program, will leave on Tuesday morning, the report said.

Musk also plans to dismiss everyone working for Tinucci and Ho, including the roughly 500 employees who work in the Supercharger group, The Information said. It was not clear how many employees worked for Ho.

Tesla’s public policy team, which was led by former executive Rohan Patel, will also be dissolved, the report said.

“Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in the email, the report said. “While some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.”

Tesla, which had 140,473 employees globally as of end-2023, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.

Ho joined Tesla in 2013 and was a program manager in the development of the Model S, the 3, and the Y before being put in charge of all new vehicles, while Tinucci joined in 2018 as a senior product manager, according to their LinkedIn profiles.

Two other senior leaders — Patel and battery development chief Drew Baglino — announced their departures earlier this month, when Tesla also ordered the layoffs of more than 10% of its workforce.

Tesla is grappling with falling sales and an intensifying price war, which led to its quarterly revenue falling for the first time since 2020, the company reported last week.

Musk made progress towards rolling out Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance package in China, the epicenter of the EV price war, during a surprise visit to Beijing on Sunday.

That trip came just over a week after he scrapped a planned trip to India, where Tesla has long sought to start operations, due to “very heavy Tesla obligations.”

stocks,Apple,DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly,"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.

Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.

“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.

The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.

The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.

The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.

“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.

Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.

“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”

The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.

“This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.

iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming

The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.

Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.

“Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.

“Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.

The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.

The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.

Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.

“Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.

The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.

Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.

Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.

Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

stocks,Apple,Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

“If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.” 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.  

“We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

“I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

stocks,Apple,Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming,"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.

This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.

The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.

Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.”

Apple response:

In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.

“The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” Apple said in a statement.

“Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.”

Apple said that a “large part” of Spotify’s success is thanks to the Cupertino giant’s App Store, “along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.”

Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That’s because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.

Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.

Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.

The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.

The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices.

These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

stocks,Apple,Apple has gotten so big it’s almost overtaken France’s entire stock market,"Apple Inc., the world's most valuable publicly traded business, continues its amazing run, setting historic highs and approaching the market value of France's stock market. With a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, Apple is larger than all but the six largest stock markets in the world. This isn't the first time Apple surpassed Paris in terms of value; they swapped places several times during the previous year's second-half selloff.

The French stock market is likewise at an all-time high, driven by luxury goods giants such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA. This spike followed a mid-summer slowdown but has resumed as data suggests that inflation is decreasing and there are no signs of a US recession.

A comparable economic backdrop in the United States has resulted in a returning rally in technology companies, with Apple rising more than 50% in 2023, adding over $1 trillion to the market capital. This represents a major shift from October when Apple faced pressure over revenue growth and sales in China.

Looking ahead, Wall Street predicts that Apple's sales will re-accelerate in 2024, due to a shown rebound in demand for smartphones, laptops, and PCs.

stocks,Apple,Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland ,"Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

stocks,crypto,Nvidia pays $5.5 million for allegedly hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners,"Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)

""Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.

The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.

Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.

Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”""",1199,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ukadoa/nvidia_pays_55_million_for_allegedly_hiding_how/

stocks,crypto,Apple tightens its rules on crypto and NFTs. Any trading service of NFTs must use Apple’s in-app payment mechanism where Apple gets 30% cut,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/apple-tightens-its-rules-on-crypto-and-nfts-in-its-app-store.html

Apple clarified its rules on cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) laying out what apps are allowed to do with these technologies. On crypto exchanges, Apple said in updated App Store rules on Monday, that apps may facilitate “transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange.” But the app can only be offered in countries or regions where it has licensing and permission to operate a crypto exchange. “Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality,” such as cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency wallets. Apple has clarified the rules on NFTs, which can be a digital representation of a real-life asset such as artwork and are usually purchased using cryptocurrency. The guidelines say apps may use in-app purchases to sell NFTs and sell services related to them, such as minting, listing, and the transferring of these tokens. Apps can also allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others so long as the apps do “not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”

All of this means that any sort of trading service for NFTs must use Apple’s in-app payment mechanism. Apple takes an up to 30% cut of in-app payments. While this does not ban NFTs in any way, it does put a major restriction on the kind of services that can be offered involving NFTs, given the 30% slice Apple takes. Apple’s 30% cut has long been criticized by app makers who accuse the technology giant of running a monopoly over in-app purchases. Apple argues that control over the App Store allows it to ensure the security of apps and payments. It has also said that the App Store has birthed a successful app ecosystem allowing developers to make money.",292,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yd4rdd/apple_tightens_its_rules_on_crypto_and_nfts_any/

\-----------Original post below-----------

* \-24% in Q1 2019
* \-30% in Q2 2019
* \-17% in Q3 2019
* \-5% in Q4 2019

Nvidia's stock price dropped by about 53% during this period. It didn't recover until the pandemic-fueled boom.

This is because when crypto crashes, miners will flood the market with used GPUs, giving bargain prices to gamers. MSRP prices for gaming GPUs doubled during the boom. What happens when GPU prices drop to half of MSRP?

In the last 3 months, ETH mining profitability has dropped by 50%. 70% in the last 6 months. This doesn't even account for electricity cost inflation.

ETH itself is down 30% in the last 7 days.

**Nvidia does not break out its gaming and crypto sales. (Comment: Nvidia ""gaming"" revenue fell short by $1b)** They lump both categories into their gaming sales category. Therefore, no one can reliably model the impact. But if I have to guess, it won't be as bad as 2018 if crypto does not go back up because Nvidia's overall revenue has diversified a bit since 2018.

However, 2018 is very different than 2022 for Nvidia. In 2018, Nvidia only faced the crypto crash. In 2022, Nvidia faces a triple whammy: **recession-risk** (GPUs are a non-essential good and expensive), **people going outside more** (less gaming), and **crypto crash** (mining). While some companies are facing one or two of these issues, very few are impacted by all three.

Like most tech companies during the pandemic-boom, Nvidia also hired a ton of workers and started projects that don't either don't make any money or loses money. Nvidia's employee count went from \~13,000 to \~22,000 from 2020 to 2022.

The question is, is Wallstreet ready for negative Nvidia revenue growth? Do you think Wallstreet has already priced this in? Right now, Nvidia's PE is still at a premium over the market. What happens when its growth is negative for 4 quarters?

  Hey stock traders & investors, we felt it was essential for us to have a small ""fireside"" talk and remind everyone of our rules regarding meme stocks, penny stocks, and crypto. 
Currently, we are receiving a lot of reports, and mod mails around ""meme"" stocks and crypto, and we want to clear the air here.
Lately, we're seeing more & more posts regarding meme stocks. We define meme stocks as a stock that has a significant following (like a cult) from a non-traditional trader; attracts considerable social media attention surrounding the stock; cult members follow mentions and brigade by sharing mass links upvote regardless of the quality; thread jacking every post and spamming the meme stock so no other stock can be discussed.

The main goal of the cult for any meme stock is to pump the price. 

 These are different from penny stocks which we class as stocks that have traded less than $5 / share over the last six months or have a market cap of less than $300m.

But penny stocks share something in common with meme stocks: The pump in price. However, they go through extreme pump & dump campaigns continually losing value making them ""cheap"" and where you encourage others to buy 100s of 1000s of shares thinking ""cheap"" is a good deal but the penny stock promoter sells their shares at the top of the pump, then repeats at a lower price convincing you to buy another round of 100s of 1000s of shares, either through group chats, spamming social media, or forums like these; it is illegal and will not be tolerated and you will face a ban.

 Crypto: We do not have any plans to allow crypto or NFT talk here that are unrelated to stocks. This subreddit is for stocks only. We will keep expanding crypto-related stocks like COIN if those discussions are related to the **quantitative**, **fundamental**, and **technical** aspects of said stock such as **price movements, cashflow, C-staff changes such as CEO replacements, earnings reports, product changes that will affect the stock price, etc**.
 
 Crypto specific or NFT specific posts will not be permitted and the mods will remove those posts. Repeat offenders will be banned.
We are aware that GME is pushing for an NFT store; GME has sales of $6B TTM so if the NFT store makes, let's say, less than 5% of the $6B sales ($300m TTM) we'll consider it crypto spam/shilling and remove it; **NFT hype for stocks is going to be considered crypto shilling.**

 Our best examples of meme stocks are AMC & GME, see the wiki below how we determined meme stocks in depth, but we all know GME is a meme and has several cults on Reddit. If you want to spam about GME then you can do that on other sub reddit, see the links and wikis below. 

 **We actually allow discussions on meme stocks.**  However, we need to ensure that we do not become simply a meme stock sub drowning in a flood of posts discussing the same exact stock every day, and to do that, we implemented some protocols we set up in 2020 when the meme stock mania took hold:

* We will limit the number of posts that are submitted to r/stocks that are around meme stocks.

* They must be high quality and based upon verifiable data.

  * News must come from a mainstream news broadcaster that focuses on stocks (for example, we will permit the Financial times, CNBC etc. but not Fox, BBC etc.).

  * Automod will remove Twitter or youtube posts. Automod will police this, and the method it decides what is low effort or not will change dynamically to deal with the volume of mentions of said meme stock.

 * We will not permit any conspiracy theories at all. There needs to be evidence and grounded.

  * While we have a criteria for meme stocks (see wiki below), the mods will have full discretion at all times. Simply posting the meme stock ticker and nothing else or similar low effort comments will be removed, and circumventing automod or another mod will result in a ban.

 * And with the help of the r/stocks community, whenever someone uses the report button to identify shilling, it helps the mod team focus their efforts on actual shilling and spam; thanks! 

 The users of r/stocks don't want to discuss the same exact stock multiple times a day, every single day, and we don't want to be shilled to.

We're desperately trying to warn the community of the manipulation that's going on here just to get you to pour your money into these types of things so that they can sell at a higher price and you're left holding the bag with no one to sell to. That's not how you build wealth in the long term with stocks. 

 See our [wiki on meme stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/meme-stocks) and our [wiki on crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/crypto-general) and please post to r/superstonk for GME fun/speculation/rumors/conspiracies and r/cryptocurrencies or r/cryptocurrency for crypto/NFTs, and see our main wiki for all the [related financial subs (or non financial subs like politics) (at the bottom).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)

investing,stock market,The stock market is a total joke…,"Up 3% yesterday, down 3% this morning. How does any of this make any sense anymore? 

Can anyone explain these wide market swings? At this point, they’re starting to seem arbitrary to me. But, then again, I’m just a passive trader trying to scrape together enough to maybe retire one day. What do I know?

Edit: I should clarify that I’ve been casually invested since 2009 and do have a bit of knowledge about the market’s historical volatility. My post is mostly just venting. 

But, what’s really been confusing me are the extremes of the market’s swings this year, as compared to others. It is not normal or typical market behavior to have a record increase one day immediately followed by a record decrease the next day. The current labor climate and supply chain issues have been ongoing for more than a year, so that shouldn’t be new news to investors. 

As a long term investor, I’ll continue to buy and weather the storm. But, again, my point is that, as I understand it, the volatility over the past year is historically anomalous and I was curious if anyone could put it into perspective for me.",1545,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/uizkxs/the_stock_market_is_a_total_joke/
investing,stock market,The paradox that the stock market on average will return 8% to 10% but will not return 8% to 10% on average.,"So I haven't been on this subreddit long, but but a common theme I have seen is people doing stuff like saving to buy a house in 3-5 years and wondering if they should put their down payment into the S&P during those 3-5 years so they can get 8% to 10% interest. Another (and the one that inspired me to actulay wtrite this) is someone complaining that the S&P is basicly the same as where it was in July of 2021 and wondering why there hasent been a 8% to 10% profit over that time.

Year on year data for the S&P is aviable in several places, but just to pick one reference, let use [https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns) Lets copy/paste the table here .....

Years where the return was exactly 8% to 10% : 1959 1965 2004 2016

When parsed this way, its fairly straightforward to see that when you add up all of the times it was under 8% and put that together with all the times it was over 10% that it balances out to 8%-10%. However, actually getting the 8% to 10% is a rare occurrence, happening only four times over the past century.

Four!

This is one of those counter intuitive things about stats. Kind of like how if a medical test is 99% accurate and your test is positive that does not mean you have a 99% chance of having the condition. Or like how it can be the case that for women medicine A is better than medicine B and for men medicine A is better than medicine B but together for the population as a whole medicine B is better than medicine A. Its just ""common sense"" that if an average is 8% to 10% then that should mean that 8% to 10% is the most common happening. But it does not work that way.

I know I am shouting into the void here. No matter what I say or do it is not going to stop the flow of people thinking that the S&P is a sure bet to return 8% to 10%. But I just had to say something to get it out of my system.",1852,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/svvmau/the_paradox_that_the_stock_market_on_average_will/
investing,stock market,My mom (69) is asking me if she should invest in the stock market ,"My mom doesn’t make much money. She’s had enough where she can retire in a few years, but money will be tight. She recently started asking me about investing in the stock market because she’s hearing it’s going up. I told her that in my opinion at her age, if you invest in the stock market, you have to be prepared to lose it. Because even though the market will usually go back up, it might not come up  by the time that she needs it.

That said, I dont know much about investing and thought it would be worth asking here. With the stock market seeing gains, is it worth her investing 5-10k in the short term? Or is there a safer option. I was thinking eft’s, but again, I don’t know nearly as much as you all. 

I’m not sure how much she has in retirement saved. Most of it is through the Texas teachers retirement system, so it’s not a set amount $$, instead it’s based on the average salary of her final 5 years (which isn’t much)

I have written an algo determining (stock specific) sentiment, I ran this on a dataset with (financial) news headlines (about 900k headlines), Twitter headlines en (stock related) Reddit headlines. From that I compared sentiment to the SP500 and I compared the intensity and volume of negative headlines to the VIX. This resulted in the two plots shown.

Since the plot is somewhat full, I made it interactive so one can show for example only Reddit sentiment and zoom in and out of datapoints. This is in html, but Im not sure whether its allowed to share the link here so in case one is interested to play around with it shoot me a pm.

investing,stock market,Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s why,"Which is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

# Financials and Fundamentals

**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

* **2025E EBITDA:** 21%
* **2025E Free Cash Flow:** $390MM
* **'20E-'25E CAGR:** 68% (Peer median 37%)
* **'22E-'25E Scaling Gross Margins:** 13-25% (Peer median 23%)
* **'21E Valuation:** 6.5x (Peer median 16.2x)
* **'22E Valuation:** 3.6x (Peer median 10.3x)
* These are very attractive valuations considering the growth compared to peers.
* **Trading Median (as of January 2021):** 1.6 transaction value/trading value (Trading median 3.1)
* **Revenue '21E:** $246MM (Peer median $120MM)
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Traded Mobility Tech Leaders:** $4.7Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Mobility SPAC Transactions:** $4.3Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Proterra:** $1.6Bn

**Let's do a little evaluating ourselves:**

**Shares outstanding post-merger:** 240.1MM

**Based on January ACTC prices pre NASDAQ sell-off:** $24/share

* 240.1MM \* $24/share = 5.76Bn Market Cap
* Let's find Proterra's value here without the SPAC shenanigans.
* 5.76Bn - $852MM = 4.91Bn Market Cap without SPAC cash
* 2022E estimated revenue is 439M
* 2022E adjusted .7561 for present value is 332M
* So unadjusted EV/Rev = 11.18
* And adjusted EV/Rev = 14.78
* Competitor EV/Rev = 10.3x on average for 2022E
* Proterra claims an 84% premium
* 1.84 \* 10.3 = 18.95
* So the industry metric is 18.95x.

**UNADJUSTED:**

* 439 unadjusted x 18.9 = 8.3B
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $9.162Bn unadjusted market cap
* 9.162/240.1 = **$38.16 unadjusted**
* 9.162Bn - 5.76Bn = **3.402Bn undervalued**

**ADJUSTED:**

* 332 \* 18.9 = 6.274Bn
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $7.126Bn adjusted market cap
* 7.126/240.1 = **$29.58 adjusted**
* 7.126 - 5.76 = **$1.366Bn undervalued**

**Average between adjusted and unadjusted:**

* Dollar value: $2.384Bn undervalued
* **Fair share price: $33.87**

[Here is another analyst finding it undervalued in a similar way on Feb 10th.](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/actc-stock-arclight-spac-merger-proterra-undervalued/)

*Let's think about that for a moment...*

As of this writing ACTC is trading at $15.65, based on purely fundamentals without speculation it is trading **116.42% below it's actual value.**

# Conclusion

Proterra is not only the most undervalued stock on the entire market, it's also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years. With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April (although the official statement is ""the first half of this year""). 

The company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the ""fair"" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.

**Bear Case:** I literally can't think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either I'm missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick.

**How to Play?**

I am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that's an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day.

1. Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
2. Warrants, ACTCW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
3. Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)
4. Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you'll get a nice premium or you'll own some shares at a really nice discount.

**Positions:**

3,865 shares @ 22.37

10C 04/16 $20.00

12C 05/21 $22.50

17C 05/21 $25.00

6C 08/20 $35

**TL;DR:** Fundamental's alone show this company is already **116.42% undervalued**, factor in hype, forward-thinking, IPO, etc. and I can't even come up with a PT. I would *expect* a PT post-merger to travel upwards to \~$50-$60 and settle back down no lower than $34. EOY my prediction is \~$70-$80. 2025 prediction is \~$300-$500. I recommend you read. I wouldn't want to gloss this one over if I were you. If you prefer you could simply check out [their investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf) 

**EDIT:** The 10.3 factor is from an EV basket that includes many direct and indirect competitors. The list is in the presentation. 

**EDIT 2:** This is a fundamental DD. There are a lot of comments regarding other competitors not mentioned. Most of the companies not mentioned were including in the 10.3 factor for diversity. A lot of these competitors being mentioned are bus manufacturers, Proterra is a fleet level ecosystem infrastructure provider. They don’t just make buses. 

**EDIT 3:** Fair warning, even though Proterra is significantly undervalued, there are other market mechanics at play. With the NASDAQ sell off its uncertain how much lower ACTC will go if at all. I think this is an excellent play, now you just need excellent timing.

**EDIT4:** Added “2025E” to EDIBTA

Any words urging someone to do something is only going as far as suggesting they do their own DD, it is in no way an attempt to convince anyone to make any financial decisions.

investing,stock market,Stop stressing about which party is better for the stock market: The data shows it doesn’t matter much," [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/are-republicans-or-democrats-better-for-the-stock-market.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/are-republicans-or-democrats-better-for-the-stock-market.html)

&#x200B;

For investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul, fear not: Elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices.

President Donald Trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the [presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/election-2020-live-results-updates-trump-biden.html). Some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a “blue wave” if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, win the White House and keep control of the House.

However, history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress. 

“I think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 

### Are Republicans or Democrats better for stocks? 

Data over the past 78 years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with long-term changes in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Starting in 1942, the numbers indicate that Republican and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election. 

The same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the House and Senate, against stock prices in the S&P 500 during that period. 

The data yields similar results for the November to November cycle, which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election, as well as January to January, which shows the actual market performance of the Congress. 

### Presidents and stocks 

Where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of Congress. 

Data compiled by LPL Financial shows that beginning in 1950, the average annual stock return was 17.2% under a split Congress, 13.4% when Republicans held both chambers, and 10.7% when Democrats had control.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said in a note that “markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn’t have too much sway,” hence the stronger stock performance during a split Congress.

But when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers, the trend of a split Congress being best for stocks doesn’t always hold true. 

Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, looked at how the market has performed under six political scenarios: a White House and Congress all under the same party, a White House with a split Congress, and a White House and Congress hailing from two different parties. Stovall included election data going back to 1945.

Of all the possible combinations, stocks appear to perform best when a Democrat is in the White House and the Congress is split. The second highest returns happen when a Democrat is president and Republicans control the Congress.

 

But ultimately, Stovall said, investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers. 

“It’s a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want,” he said. “If you want to favor the Democrats, talk about the presidency. If you want to favor the Republicans, talk about House control.“  


Bob French, director of investment analysis at McLean Asset Management, agrees. “We can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want.”

However the vote plays out Tuesday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee thinks the stock market is poised to take off.

“At least 90% of \[our\] portfolio strategy would be identical under either win,” Lee said in a note on Oct. 6. In either case, Lee predicts the outcome of the election will be bullish for stocks.",2859,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jnexf3/stop_stressing_about_which_party_is_better_for/

investing,investment,Yesterday I officially hit $100k invested in 401k at 29 years old.,"Just wanted to share to demonstrate to the newer investors that consistent contributions paired with a strategy that you are confident in will pay you back over time.

Since i joined the work force in 2016, my 401k was mostly in target dates funds, and company stock, getting miniscule returns. Additionally i messed around a few times with a few thousand doing my own stock picking in a brokerage account (almost exclusively losing money).

At the end of 2021 i backed off from the brokerage account, and moved 100% of my 401k into an SP500 tracker. During this time i was contributing 10% of my salary ($101,000) with a 5% employer match. Even with the turbulent market the past year and a half, this was by far my best investment decision ever, other than buying my house in 2019.

I plan to continue this strategy for the next 15 years or more. My only question is when do i start moving money into a less volatile investment product as i approach retirement?

2. **Age 50’s:** From 2000 to 2002, the *“Dot.Com”* crash cuts their savings by 50%.

investing,bull market,Answers to the 10 most asked questions regarding the uranium bull market,"I have to be honest, I didn’t expect to make another post so soon, but I have been flooded with messages and comments in the past few days, so I deemed it necessary (oh and also for the people crowning me things like the ‘uranium messiah’, ‘uranium guru’ and ‘that one uranium guy’, I am flattered, so thank you). Since my last post I have gotten a lot of questions regarding investing in uranium, the thesis, nuclear power, geopolitical changes and what the bear case for uranium is. So, I have decided to make a post highlighting the 10 most commonly asked questions so that more people can read my general answers to those and be informed about them. Here they are:  

  

Q: Isn’t nuclear power being phased out around the world?  

 
A: No it isn’t, the US now has bipartisan support for it, Canada is looking at SMR technology, the UK intends to build small modular reactors, France has pushed back the phasing out of their nuclear power fleet from 2025 to 2035, several Eastern European countries are planning new reactors, China and the Middle-East are heavily pushing the construction of new power plants and there are many other examples of nuclear power being favored once more.  

  

Q: What companies should I invest in within the uranium sector:  

  
A: Check my post history and the subsequent comments, especially from my last post, to get an idea of specific stock picks. I don’t want to violate any subreddit guidelines by posting them here. What I can post however, is that everyone should check out the URNM etf and their holdings to get started.  

  

Q: Uranium has been trending downwards for almost a decade, who should it change now?  


A: COVID-19 has really blown this market wide open and probably made sure this bull market started earlier by a margin of at least 1 or perhaps even 2 years. This rally was built on historic seasonality, bipartisan support from the US government and their strategic reserve bill, geopolitical backing of nuclear power, the closing of Cigar Lake (one of the world’s largest uranium mines) and the covering of uranium investing by some of the more mainstream investment outlets.  

  

Q: Did I miss the run already?  

  
A: No, we are nowhere close to reaching the end of this run and we probably still have years left before we see anything resembling a top. There are 6 phases to this investment and we are only just now barely starting to see the end of phase 1. Remember, the spot price of uranium needs to go to approximately $67.10 a pound to incentivize enough new production to have even a shout of fixing the supply deficit, although common consensus within the sector is that we need even more than that and that the spot price can reach inflation adjusted new all-time highs (~170 dollars a pound)  

  

Q: Won’t solar, wind and hydro remove the need for nuclear power and thus uranium?  

  
A: No it won’t, see the first question, it is the best and safest form of baseload green power generation we have. But for the sake of argument, let’s say we only finish the reactors currently under construction and shut all further planning of new reactors. What will happens? Guess what, the supply deficit is still significant and the thesis will still play out. There is roughly a 57 million pound supply deficit and the spot market is getting thin with both Cameco and Kazatomprom (the world’s 2 largest producers) buying on the spot market. This can’t hold out for much longer, regardless of whether or not nuclear power plants keep being constructed.  

  

Q: If the price shoots up, can’t people just find alternatives to uranium?  

  
A: No, for two key reasons. Firstly, as discussed above, we need nuclear power and we are starting to favor it more and more, which means we need a lot of uranium to meet demand. It is also impossible to change the fuel source in these nuclear reactors, you can’t just fill a plant up with natural gas or oil and hope it will do something. Secondly, unlike gas plants and coal plants, uranium is only a small portion of the total operational cost of these reactors. While with gas and coal it can be up to 80-85% of total costs, with uranium it is closer to 5-10%. This means that price can double and double again from here, without having an enormous impact on the total cost structure. Demand is relatively inelastic.  

  

Q: When prices go up, can’t Kazakhstan or some other state owned entity not just flood the market with uranium and bring the price back down?  

  
A: They can’t and they won’t (Kazatomprom has tended to favor quality over quantity since 2017). First of all, it can take up to 2 years for uranium to go from the ground all the way through the enrichment process and be ready to be used as fuel. This means that even if it was possible and these companies start pumping out massive amounts of uranium, it would take up to 2 years for it to even be used as fuel. This is why security of supply needs to be met years in advance, so that a reactor does not sit there without a fuel source. In terms of the fuel cycle, we are already well into 2023. In terms of the development of new uranium sources to reach the market, we might be in 2030 already. A decade is tomorrow in uranium.  

  

Q: But isn’t there hundreds of millions of pounds of uranium on earth?  

  
A: Yes there is, but no one is going to mine that at these prices. It takes many years to fully permit and construct a uranium mine in most countries. There might be plenty of supply out there, but there certainly isn’t a way to reach it easily without significant price incentive. Figures of 130 dollars or more per pound of uranium have been quoted as being needed to get to all these different sources of uranium.  

  

Q: What are some catalysts to look out for in 2021?  

  
A: There are several. Biden’s implementation of the ‘green new deal’, reactors finishing construction and being activated (needing around 3x as much uranium to start with to build a fuel core), the closure of two uranium mines (Ranger and Cominak, a combined ~7 million pounds a year, gone), long term contract negotiations, spot price increasing to meet the  increase in enrichment prices of the past few years, institutional money getting into the sector and last but not least more news on the development and possible implementation of small modular reactor technology. All these catalyst make 2021 a year to look forward to for uranium.  

  

Q: When should I sell my shares?  

  
A: I can’t tell you that, tops are nearly impossible to call in any sector. However, to get an idea of how a uranium bull market can unfold, here is an article covering the entirety of the previous bull market which ended in 2007. Read it, take some notes, read it again and craft an exit strategy for yourself. This is not a lifetime hold, don’t fall in love with these stocks, there will be a time to sell.  

https://thetideoffortune.com/would-you-have-made-a-fortune-in-uranium-part-1/  


Oh and an extra point regarding whether or not you should buy into the sector after the recent price run up:
If you have not yet established a position in the market, I would advise to do so and scale in over time and extra on weakness. It is a volatile market and a pullback will come, the question is if that it today or next week after another 20% run up. 

  

So there we have it, 10 questions about the sector and the thesis. I have tried my best to provide short and easy to understand answers and I hope it helps all of you. Make sure to always do your own due diligence and asses your own risk tolerances, so that you are not shaken out by the volatility of this sector. Best of luck with your investments. ",618,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kt36if/answers_to_the_10_most_asked_questions_regarding/

investing,bull market,Interesting Take: The Bull Market is Only Beginning,"Like many of you, I thought that sometime soon our 10 year long bull market must end. I began hoarding cash anticipating a drop and a recession that could last years and depress stock prices.

Until I sat in one of my classes and my professor, a CMT, brought up an interesting point: we might only be at the start of the bull market. He brought up the classic SPX chart showing the enormous returns ever since the '08 recession. Then he brought out other indices such as the Russell 2000 (IWM) and various Emerging Market ETFs (VEA, IEFA, AIA, etc.) and pointed out an oddity: Between 2018 and March 2020, these markets have been stagnant/flat, essentially trading within a range. He explained that while growth in the S&P might have been great the last few years, practically the rest of the world lagged behind.

Basically his point was this: now that all of these other indices/stocks are joining the rally after being stagnant for years, the real bull market is just beginning.

Of course, he and I could easily be wrong. But I was interested in finding out your thoughts on this, what do you guys think?",471,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

>""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

>""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

>Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

>The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

>""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

>""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

>Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

>Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

>Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

* Apple and Epic went to court today so that Epic could argue for a temporary court order that would force Apple to unblock Fortnite from its iOS App Store. 

* ""The case is considered a potentially landmark suit, one that tests the frontiers of antitrust law, said Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.""

* Judge Gonzalez Rogers looked skeptically at many of Epic's claims, explicitly telling the company several times in the hearing she was not persuaded by its arguments or its strategy. Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.

* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. ""Walled gardens have existed for decades,"" she said. ""Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple's doing is not much different... It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.""

* Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recommended a jury trial in the case in July. “It is important enough to understand what real people think,” she said. “Do these security issues concern people or not?” (in reference to Apple's argument that tight control over its App Store to keep customers’ data secure and private.)

* In the coming days, Gonzalez Rogers is expected to rule on a temporary injunction forcing Apple to allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic’s software development tools, in the interim.

* Separately on Monday, Google announced it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system. The move means that developers who have had customers pay them directly with a credit card for digital content will soon have to use Google’s billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments.",2080,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j1orad/judge_not_convinced_by_epics_arguments_against/

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

The remainder of the cryptocurrency project that Meta Platforms Inc.’s Founder Mark Zuckerberg took a beating over from Congress is officially shutting down. Meta’s Novi pilot—a money-transfer service using the company’s own cryptocurrency digital wallet—will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance “as soon as possible.” Users won’t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”

The stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

investing,crypto,Nvidia fined $5.5 million by SEC for hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners,"Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)

""Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.

The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.

Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.

Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”""

[Edit] lots of people asking why this is illegal.

According to the investigation, Nvidia conducted internal research which indicated this was how the cards were being used. Instead of notifying shareholders about this, they claimed to be increasing their market share in the gaming sphere. Of course, this becomes problematic for investors when crypto goes into a bear market (like now), and investors are left holding bags wondering why everyone is buying second hand cards from miners all of a sudden.",2459,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ukaei2/nvidia_fined_55_million_by_sec_for_hiding_how/
investing,crypto,Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand,"New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

investing,crypto,SEC on Bitcoin ETPs: Analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51% of the reported daily bitcoin trading volume was likely bogus. Sponsor of bitcoin ETP admitted that ~95% of data used in bitcoin markets is fake and/or non-economic.,"Over the recent weeks, the approval of a Bitcoin ETP by the SEC has been interpreted by many as a sign of institutional endorsement of Bitcoin itself as a serious investment.

I find it important to highlight [this longer statement by SEC Commissioner Crenshaw](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023), which she gave after the ETP's approval. It highlights many reasons that argue against Bitcoin. The following is one of the most damning:

>Spot bitcoin markets are subject to fraud and manipulation. One form of manipulation that appears to be pervasive in the crypto markets (and specifically bitcoin markets), is wash trading, a practice whereby traders seek to increase the appearance of high trading interest by both selling and buying the same products at the same time, often driving up prices, and then selling to unwitting third party market participants at inflated values.   
>  
>Wash trading distorts price and volume, causes volatility, reduces investor confidence and participation in financial markets, and of course, results in investor harm.  
>  
>One analysis of 29 major crypto exchanges found that wash trading was, on average, **as high as 77.5%** of the total trading volume on unregulated exchanges. The same researchers estimated that wash trading was present in over $4.5 trillion of crypto spot market trading and $1.5 trillion in crypto derivatives trading in the first quarter of 2020 alone.

And further:

>Specifically with regard to bitcoin, an analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51% of the reported daily bitcoin trading volume was likely bogus.   
>  
>In fact, though reporting regarding bitcoin frequently discusses the enormous size of the market, **one market participant who now seeks to sponsor a spot bitcoin ETP has admitted that “approximately 95%” of the data used by many participants are “fake and/or non-economic**.”  
>  
>Indeed, in one salient example, according to testimony by one of his co-conspirators, the former CEO of FTX may have engaged in bitcoin price manipulation in an effort to keep its price under $20,000, presumably to the benefit of his company and himself. In short, prices and demand for bitcoin may not actually be what they appear to be.

The statement by one sponsor is particularly damning. It highlights that these companies are primarily, if not solely, interested in the fees, not in the quality of the products. This is not surprising, yet it seems to be ignored in discussions about institutional stances on Bitcoin, such as Vanguard's decision not to offer these ETPs.

I find it ludicrous to suggest that these products should be part of serious long-term portfolios, such as those for retirement.",273,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19ag6wg/sec_on_bitcoin_etps_analysis_of_157_crypto/

PayPal Holdings Inc. is exploring acquisitions of cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin custodian BitGo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would expand its embrace of digital coins.

PayPal has been holding talks with BitGo, a company that helps investors store Bitcoin securely, and could reach a deal within weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other targets, the people added.

It couldn’t be learned how much PayPal would pay for BitGo if it goes ahead with the deal. BitGo raised $58.5 million in 2018 at a $170 million valuation, according to PitchBook.

Representatives for BitGo and PayPal declined to comment.

Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was founded in 2013 by Chief Executive Officer Mike Belshe. It offers digital wallets that require multiple signatures for transactions, as well as offline vaults for storing Bitcoin and rival currencies. It was one of the first companies in the space to focus on institutional investors, according to its website.

The company applied in August to New York regulators to become an independent, regulated qualified custodian under New York State Banking Law, a press release showed. Custodians like BitCoin are responsible for safekeeping digital assets using secure storage.

PayPal announced on Wednesday that its customers can buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin from digital wallets, as well as use the virtual money to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network. The announcement led Bitcoin to surge past $13,000 for the first time since July 2019.

PayPal said it would partner with BitGo competitor Paxos Trust Company, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services for its new service.

BitGo is backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Craft Ventures, Digital Currency Group, DRW, Galaxy Digital Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund.",1171,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jgkp92/paypal_in_talks_to_buy_crypto_firms_including/

wallstreetbets,stock market,"I lost $1,030,220.81 in the stock market.","I've held this in long enough. The shame, guilt, lies. Pretending to be cool and knowing what the fuck I'm talking about. I've been holding this in for years. I've cried and cried and cried. I'm fed up with my bitch behavior. It's time to fucking take things into my own hands and change. I'm not stopping, I'm going to gain this all back the slow, and right way. Here's my story.

In 2019 I learned about the stock market. Like a responsible retail investor, I created baskets and diversified my equity investments.

In 2020, I learned about options.

My first gamble was a meme stock I found on WSB that rhymes with Ped Pad Peyon. That was the start of my entire $1M loss and life downfall.

It felt so good to see those big spikes in gains.

But it also felt like the end of the world when it all went to $0.

For some reason, I always came back. I tasted the forbidden fruit, and was addicted.

Fast forward two years, I needed a source for more trading capital - I sold my house and car, maxed out credit cards, borrowed from the bank, and lenders. I lied to family/friends to get money, and worked odd jobs that were shameful.

My wife who I'd been with for 12 years left me, we didn't sign a prenup so there was that whole process...then she took custody of the kids.

Sure, I lost $1,030,220.81. But the worst part of it all, is I lost loved ones, every friend in my life, and every single asset I owned. I cried like a fucking bitch for days on end, slept on benches, backyards, and under bridges.

I managed to save up some money, and am now living on my own, in a one-bedroom apartment.

I know it I can do this. I know I can make it all back. I've heard stories and seen people do it. I understand all the technical analysis, indicators, price action, gamma exposure, OI, risk-free interest, blah blah fucking blah. I know it all. What made me lose it all wasn't my understanding of the markets, it was my ego, my greed, and lack of discipline. My psyche.

I've spent the last 2 yrs dedicating myself to mastering every technical aspect of the market. I've met 10 figure retail investors, hedgefund managers, and everyone in between. Really dedicated myself to learning the markets. Most importantly, I've made good progress mastering my emotions. I've even gone on months without masturbating. I needed to model a stimulus that was just as rewarding as gambling.

I'm here to show that I can gradually get out of this hell-hole.

I've managed to trade back up to $25k, and in the last week I made $14k (options + futures). I will get back to $1M. I'm just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn't over.

Is it the most hedged / low risk decision? Fuck no. The degen surely lives on inside me. But I've tamed it. I guess if you're looking for entertainment, or a person to root for, you can find me on X. Username is lost1million. I'll try to give periodic updates here as well.

This is pretty much it for me. Here we go.

P.S. Please don't report me to the suicide prevention. While I appreciate the sympathy, the messages I get are quite annoying. I will be fine. I am fine.

1. Why your dad did not buy Nvidia 6 months ago?
He has invested all his money on real-estate at that time

2. Can you remind me later? 
Yes, I will! Hopefully, he makes some out of it!

wallstreetbets,investment,All-In on Tech: Why I Just Invested $2.1 Million in a Single ETF,"Hello Fellow Investors, I Need Your Advice!

Recently, my parents sold their house and entrusted me with managing the proceeds. I've just started exploring the U.S. stock market, and I'm a firm believer that technology is the future. Since tech can't thrive without semiconductors, I found the SMH ETF.

The holdings in SMH are nothing short of a ""dream team"" in the tech industry: NVIDIA, TSMC, ASML, AMD, and other semiconductor giants. In my opinion, investing in an ETF like this is better than betting heavily on a single stock, as it offers diversification without missing out on growth opportunities.

That's why I've decided to go all-in with $2.1 million and invest it entirely in SMH, with a long-term horizon of 10 to 20 years, following a value investing approach.

However, this is just my initial thought, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or feedback from experienced investors. Are there any better strategies or considerations I might be overlooking? Thank you!

wallstreetbets,bull market,Europe is going tits up or The greatest bull market in history,"**Premise**

It's not news that Europe as a continent has been struggling to keep up with the US. Innovation is lacking, regulation is abundant, cheap ru$$ian gas is gone, Germany is committing suicide, Fr\*nce is full of fr\*nch and Southern Europe is just a retirement home at this point. Ah, and the UK has being doing horribly since Brexit and food shortages are still going on even if they don't make the news.

**The numbers**

Economically speaking, if you take the GDP of the EU, you'll see that it's almost half that of the US, or about two thirds if you believe the PPP figure (you shouldn't, nobody cares how many big macs you can afford in a day, it's useless). The PPP detachment from reality can easily be observed if you take any market you like and compare the sales volume. For example, taking the car market in 2023 you can see that 22 cars were sold in the EU per 1000, while 43 cars were sold per 1000 people in the US. Sure you could say ""muh EU's got trains"", but that's only true for Western Europe which is half the total population.

In addition to this, most EU countries are facing a pension crisis that's going to obliterate the budget for infrastructures in the near future. Either that, or we are going to let pensioners live in absolute poverty to keep up the welfare state.

**The meat**

What's interesting to notice is that the financial literacy of younger Europeans is incredibly higher than the one of their parents and grandparents. On the flip side, young Europeans are incredibly broke, because of the welfare state, the Ponzi-pension schemes, and other shit which is constantly extracting value from the economy and putting it into the already fat accounts of elderly people who are not spending anything, not investing in anything and just parking their money, stopping the economy as a result.

But, all things come to an end, even their lives. And all that money is gonna flow in the pockets of young people with access to the US stock market. These generations are gonna know that the State will never be able to pay a decent pension, so they'll either invest on their own or put all that wealth into private pension funds that, you guessed it, will just invest in the US stock market, 'cause no one would ever invest in shitty EU clones of successful US businesses.

I can see that this ball is starting to roll with the current generation of Europeans entering the job market. We are looking at at least two decades of European money just pouring into the US stock market from everywhere in the EU.

wallstreetbets,bull market,For those wondering if we're in a bull market.... ,"COST, a high volume warehouse retail store, trades at 50x forward earnings while CRWD, which literally brought the country to a halt a few months ago, trades at 75x forward earnings.  Both have PE/G ratios over 3 (1 is considered fair value).

The total market cap of the S&P is 2.0x US GDP (vs. historical norm: 0.75x-1x) while the P/E 10, i.e., Shiller's CAPE, is over 100% above its arithmetic mean and over 120% above its geometric mean.

While the US will continue to ""quiet"" default through non-stop printing, total government debt to US GDP recently surpassed 100%, which suggests it's only a matter of time before the bond markets start to push back with higher rates at the long end of the yield curve.

As they say, you can't call the waves but you can time the tides.

Is anyone adjusting their asset allocation, portfolio or going hmmm based on these metrics?

Note: if you disagree, please explain your valuation methodology and how you conclude a stock (or market) is fairly valued vs overvalued.  Just saying ""people have been saying the market is overvalued for years"" or ""a correction is coming"" doesn't really address my argument unless your opinion is valuation is no longer relevant because the Fed will just keep printing until kingdom come, which is probably true.

wallstreetbets,bear market,"Remember, the stock market didn't care about Bear Stearns failing...until it did","> The Bear Stearns hedge fund failures in mid-2007 were the first sign of a crash coming, but the market didn’t register concern. Stocks rose into October, when a 5-year bull market ended as the S&P 500 stock index topped out at 1,562. In January 2008, the S&P 500 entered a correction, down 10% from the peak. But when all of Bear Stearns failed two months later, stocks remained steady, buoyed by aggressive government action to contain the damage. By May, the S&P regained a few points.

> That summer, however, mounting financial losses finally started to spook investors. By July 2008, the S&P was down 20% from the prior peak—a bear market. Stocks zig-zagged for the next two months, but panic selling began after Lehman’s bankruptcy, leaving the S&P 500 down 40% from the peak nearly a year earlier. The index would ultimately lose 57% of its value by the time it bottomed out in March 2009.

wallstreetbets,Tesla,Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created.

  
Edit: Hundreds of ya all only read point 7 and started refuting how Tesla has factories in China and Germany, so there aren't tariffs, clear skies, etc. Look, when this trade war starts, these countries will want blood. Tesla is not only the US hallmark of EVs, but its flamboyant boss is now part of the US administration that initiated the sanctions.

wallstreetbets,crypto,"Netflix director loses $11 million trading options, makes $20 million trading crypto...","Netflix gives a director $55 million dollars to produce a series. He blows most of it and begins acting erratic. 

He proceeds to put $11 million in his personal Charles Schwab account and loses it all in $5.9 million in a couple weeks trading Gilead Sciences.

He then goes and puts $4 million in Kraken to buy DogeCoin. However, unlike his stock investments, he liquidates his position for nearly $27 million.

Wife then divorces him, he sues netflix, they are currently in arbitration. 

What a fucking wild ride.

wallstreetbets,crypto,BlackRock Has Quietly Opened The Door To A ‘Trillion-Dollar Plus’ Wall Street Game-Changer Amid The $700 Billion Crypto Price Boom,"In a late November filing, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager that looks around around $10 trillion on behalf of clients, updated its bitcoin spot ETF filing to allow Wall Street banks to act as authorized participants, allowing them to bypass restrictions that prevent them from holding bitcoin and crypto on their own balance sheets.

The change comes as BlackRock and its rivals in the race to get a bitcoin spot ETF to market, including Fidelity, Grayscale Investment and Franklin Templeton, have met with the U.S. Securities ans Exchange Commission (SEC) to thrash out the details of how the ETFs would work ahead of the next appoval ""window"" opening.

""If the SEC accepts this revised, dual model of create and redeem with cash and physical, that means the liquidity that supports the ETF shares when they trade would be increased, because obviously, you have more potential APs as part of the process,"" Sui Chung, the chief executive at CF Benchmarks, which is involved in BlackRock's bitcoin spot ETF bid, told Coindesk.",3109,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/12/13/blackrock-has-quietly-opened-the-door-to-a-trillion-dollar-plus-wall-street-game-changer-amid-the-700-billion-bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-and-crypto-price-boom/
wallstreetbets,crypto,Warren Buffett believes crypto 'will come to a very bad ending' ... calls it a “mirage”,"Buffett makes some good points:

* “They don't reproduce, they can't mail you a check, they can't do anything, and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for them later on, but then that person's got the problem.”
* He adds that it’s a very effective way of anonymously transmitting money. But: “a check is a way of transmitting money too,” he said. “Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money?”
* (for the WSB regards) But people like to gamble, he told CNBC after a 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, which is another problem with nonproductive assets. “If you don’t understand it, you get much more excited than if you understand it. You can have anything you want to imagine if you just look at something and say, ‘that’s magic.’”

wallstreetbets,crypto,Scam Alert: Wallstreetbets Telegram / Crypto,"#ANY INVESTMEMT WITH THE WSB NAME IS UNRELATED TO WSB.

---

What is it with loser ex-mods hijacking the WSB name and using crypto to scam people?

People keep posting a press release about an ""official"" WallStreetBets distributed app. (Aka, a crypto pyramid scheme) 

Nothing could be further from the truth. We are strongly anti-monetization. This scam has nothing to do with us. 

This is yet another attempt for the pathetic and disgraced founder (removed by Reddit Admins in 2020) to cash out on a subreddit whose only contributions allegedly include:

* Phishing our users

* Attempting to run a shitty paid mentoring group

* Selling advertising on the subreddit

* Trying to turn options trading into an esport

* Selling WSB out to movie producers

* Attempting to change our logo to some god awful abomination

Don't throw away your money on this scam. 

Throw it away on OTM FDs instead.

wallstreetbets,crypto,"I'm highly against the potential opening of the market to 24/7 trading, after spending the last 3 years in crypto futures. Here's why:","As a trader, you thrive on volatility. You thrive on movements. With the market only ""open"" for a set period of time, it essentially ensures that - if there's going to be volatility or movement - it's far and away most likely to occur within the timeframe that the market is open (obvious exception being futures, but even then - large movements after/pre-hours are comparatively rare). This ensures faster, more efficient movement - allowing active day-traders to make money within that timeframe.

I've traded crypto futures for the last three years. What I've seen most frequently happen in said 24/7 market, is that you'll see long, extended, seemingly endless periods of consolidation, punctuated by either a rapid, ""almost random"" high-volatility movement, or a very slow, progressive, multiple day trend. While said movement ""may"" occur within standard US trading hours, it may also occur outside.

In traditional finance, with open market hours, you're far more likely to see some sort of decent movement occur nearly every day within open hours. It feels consistent, repeatable, and has a feeling of market efficiency ""correcting & moving the market price to where it's intended to be"" within the short timeframe where the market is available.

By opening up trading to 24/7 hours, I expect movements will be much more similar to crypto; in terms of either huge sudden movements at any given sudden time after 2 days of extended consolidation - or long, slow-moving, protracted movements that generate insecurity in your position and often premature closing of position.

The only ones who benefit from 24/7 markets are 1) Algos, 2) Institutional players entering and exiting large positions incrementally, and 3) Longer-term swing traders. 

The daily volatility will largely disappear, without the need for entering/exiting positions within a specific timeframe.

wallstreetbets,crypto,Crypto ETF's Make Absolutely no sense,"Okay, Honest question does anyone actually see the value of a Bitcoin ETF? 

Holding a basket of fake money, paying management fees for the privilege, when you could just buy Bitcoin, no extra fees, and keep it separate from the crooked banks. It's Cleary the only coin any of us really care about.  It makes no sense to me. GOLD made sense because no one wants to lug around a fuck ton of gold and it all came from all over the world, but fake money from the internet? What am I missing? I can't see this ever getting into any boomers VERY LOW risk portfolio so why even bother other than to scam simps their management fees. 

*edit, I’m a bit of a muppet and originally thought other coins may be included as a way to diversify like other ETFs. It’s clear now this is just for bitcoin but for the above reasons I still don’t get it. It’s easier than it’s ever been to buy btc again boomers hate risk.
